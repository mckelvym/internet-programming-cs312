   Column 19: Plea for Deliverance (A Noncanonical Psalm)
 </H3>
 </CENTER> <BR><BR>
 <H4>
1. Surely a maggot cannot praise thee nor a grave worm recount thy loving-kindness.<BR>
2. But the living can praise thee, even those who stumble can laud thee. In revealing<BR>
3. thy kindness to them and by thy righteousness thou dost enlighten them. For in thy hand is the soul of every<BR>
4. living thing; the breath of all flesh hast thou given. Deal with us, O LORD,<BR>
5. according to thy goodness, according to thy great mercy, and according to thy many righteous deeds. The LORD<BR>
6. has heeded the voice of those who love his name and has not deprived them of his loving-kindness.<BR>
7. Blessed be the LORD, who executes righteous deeds, crowning his saints<BR>
8. with loving-kindness and mercy. My soul cries out to praise thy name, to sing high praises<BR>
9. for thy loving deeds, to proclaim thy faithfulness--of praise of thee there is no end. Near death<BR>
10. was I for my sins, and my iniquities have sold me to the grave; but thou didst save me,<BR>
11. O LORD, according to thy great mercy, and according to thy many righteous deeds. Indeed have I<BR>
12. loved thy name, and in thy protection have I found refuge. When I remember thy might my heart<BR>
13. is brave, and upon thy mercies do I lean. Forgive my sin, O LORD,<BR>
14. and purify me from my iniquity. Vouchsafe me a spirit of faith and knowledge, and let me not be dishonored<BR>
15. in ruin. Let not Satan rule over me, nor an unclean spirit; neither let pain nor the evil<BR>
16. inclination take possession of my bones. For thou, O LORD, art my praise, and in thee do I hope<BR>
17. all the day. Let my brothers rejoice with me and the house of my father, who are astonished by the graciousness...<BR>
18. [ ] For e[ver] I will rejoice in thee.<BR><BR>
