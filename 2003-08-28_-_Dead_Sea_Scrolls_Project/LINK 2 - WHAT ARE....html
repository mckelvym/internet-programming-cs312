The Dead Sea Scrolls were most likely written by the Essenes during the period from about 200 B.C. to 68 A.D.  The scrolls that have been found are either biblical or non biblical and written mostly in Hebrew as well as some Aramaic (the common language of Palestine Jews) and a few texts are in Greek. Most of the books of the bible have been found on the Dead Sea Scrolls. The last words of several biblical figures have been found written on some of the scrolls. Some unknown bible stories are also found as well as things left out of the bible. The scrolls are the oldest Old Testament texts ever found, with the Isaiah Scroll believed to be over 1000 years older than any other copy of Isaiah. None of the scrolls refer to Jesus, nor his follower's. The scrolls that are non biblical contain commentaries about the old testament, underground maps and hiding places, expansions of the Law, rule books, war conduct, psalms, and other texts.

The scrolls seem to be the library of a Jewish sect that was hidden in caves when the Roman army advanced against this sect of Jews. The scrolls are mostly made of animal skins, some papyrus, and one of copper. The scrolls have furthered our knowledge of Judaism and Christianity. They show the Christian roots in Judaism.
