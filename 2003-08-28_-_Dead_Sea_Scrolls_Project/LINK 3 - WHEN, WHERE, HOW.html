The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the caves on the shore of the Dead Sea between 1947 and 1956. Bedouin shepherds were searching for a stray goat in the Judean desert and found the jars of ancient scrolls in a cave. There were seven initial scrolls found, with many more to be found during the next decade. The texts are numbered for each cave they were discovered in.

The Dead Sea is in Israel and Jordan. It is on average 1,000 feet deep, and in some parts is the saltiest sea. It is also the lowest body of water in the world. It is supplied by small streams, and the Jordan River. Humidity is low in the area, with very arid areas which are ideal for the preservation of the scrolls.
